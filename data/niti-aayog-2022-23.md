INTRODUCTION

NITI Aayog has been entrusted with the mandate to design strategic and long-term policy and
programme frameworks and initiatives, and monitor progress and their efficacy, with the active
involvement of states, civil society, and other think tanks.

In 2022–23, as India has entered into Amrit Kaal, the 25-year-long leadup to India@100, NITI Aayog
has taken a lead to enhance macro-economic level growth along with its focus on micro-economic
level all-inclusive welfare.

ASPIRATIONAL DISTRICTS PROGRAMME

The Aspirational Districts Programme (ADP) completed five years in January 2023—with nearly two of
those years in the throes of the COVID-19 pandemic. As such, the ADP has been part of an unprecedented
period in the lifetime of the Districts, and what has emerged is promising.

The programme has acted as a successful template of good and effective governance, Under this
programme India’s 112 backward districts have shown remarkable progress across key sectors that
matter to the people. The core strength of the programme is its focus on data driven governance that
drives evidence-based policy interventions at the district-level. NITI Aayog monitors the 112 Aspirational
districts on Key Performance Indicators (KPI) on a monthly basis. The KPIs are designed in a way that
the input and process indicators are being evaluated so as to achieve desirable outputs and outcomes
across major socio-economic themes such as health & nutrition, education, agriculture & water

resources, financial inclusion & skill development, and basic infrastructure. The robust monitoring
strategy has enabled the district administration to engage in cross-departmental reviews and thus
drive convergence. The competition through the monthly release of delta ranks keeps the districts
constantly motivated to improve the KPIs.
The districts have shown significant progress across themes in the last five years. Under Health and
Nutrition, districts have shown good progress in indicators related to pregnant women’s health and
child nutrition. Indicators such as antenatal care registrations, child immunisation, and provision of
supplementary nutrition have shown major progress. School infrastructure and basic infrastructure
indicators such as sanitation and electrification are also nearing saturation.
The programme continues to deliver results over the years because it has succeeded in synergizing the
efforts of all stakeholders—Central and state governments, district administration, non-governmental
organizations, private partners, civil society, and the masses. The line ministries have developed short-
term and long-term plans to improve their respective indicators in the districts and Central Prabhari
Officers have been appointed to guide and mentor the districts.
NITI Aayog has developed and uses “The Champions of Change” dashboard for real-time data
collection and monitoring NITI Aayog has captured the success stories through publications ‘Stories
of Change’ and ‘Best Practices’. These interventions—selected based on the usage of behavioural
principles, innovation, replicability and potential for impact—demonstrate how behavioural insights
and innovative initiatives can drive outcomes on the ground. NITI Aayog also regularly shares the best
practices with other districts to transform service delivery at the grass-root level. Significant progress
could be achieved by scaling up these best practices that emerged from the districts to other parts
of the country grappling with similar challenges.
```
```
Aspirational Blocks Programme
Guided by the Hon’ble Prime Minister’s vision, NITI Aayog has undertaken various efforts to replicate
the ADP Model through flagship initiatives. Hon’ble Prime Minister launched the launched Aspirational
Blocks Programme (ABP) which aim to fast track holistic and sustainable development in 500 backward
Blocks. Under ABP, 500 backward blocks are being selected from 28 States and 4 UTs in India through
extensive consultation with different ministries and state governments. The programme would support
blocks to achieve accelerated and coordinated implementation of various schemes to be to improve
their performance and come to par with the state average at par or better than other blocks in
the states. Incentives for high performing blocks are being worked out and blocks that achieve
noticeable progress on key indicators would be provided incentives. Under Mission Utkarsh, Ministries/
Departments, which have most public interface, have shortlisted the most backward districts on the
basis of their respective KPIs and are working towards bringing these backward districts at par with
state averages in the next one year and the national average within the next two years.

HEALTH AND NUTRITION

Integrative Health Policy

An integrative health policy to achieve inclusive, affordable, and evidence-based healthcare is
being conceptualised. A core committee and four working groups were constituted to look at core
areas of education, research, clinical practice, and public health administration, which have given
recommendations for integrative approaches for functional integration. The recommendations have
been presented to the Hon’ble Union Ministers of both administrative Ministries i.e. Ministry of Health
and Family Welfare and Ministry of Ayush. Work on the final document is underway.

National Tele-Mental Health Programme

NITI Aayog, in collaboration with NIMHANS Bengaluru, conceptualized the framework for the national
tele-mental health services, following which a national tele-mental health programme to provide 24x7
free counseling and care to people was announced in the Union Budget 2022-23. The programme is
expected to improve access to quality mental health counseling and care services.

Orphan Drugs and Therapies for Rare Diseases

More than 7000 rare diseases are known today, affecting 300 million people worldwide and about
90 million in India alone. The area of rare diseases is complex and heterogeneous. The number
of disorders with known molecular basis is rapidly rising, but the number of approved therapies
lags far behind. Keeping this in view, a committee on ‘Drugs and Dosage Forms for Rare Diseases:
Engagement with manufacturers’ was constituted with Member (Health), NITI Aayog as Chair and
representation from Department of Pharmaceuticals and clinicians to consider identification of a set
of priority disorders/indications and their corresponding treatments that can be enabled for domestic
manufacturing of orphan drugs. As of January 2023, the Committee has convened five meetings to
engage with a shortlisted set of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) manufacturers.

Reforms in the National Organ Transplant Programme
Organ donation and transplantation is a government-regulated activity in India as per the provisions
of the Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissues Act, which was first passed by the Parliament in
```
1994. NITI Aayog has taken the initiative to examine the National Organ Transplant Programme (NOTP),
and is in the process of enabling the setting up of an improved and enhanced NOTP in collaboration
with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoH&FW), Directorate General of Health Services
(DGHS), and National Organ & Tissue Transplant Organisation (NOTTO).
The inter-state transportation of donated organs is considered as a challenge in the NOTP Guidelines
2021. NITI Aayog has prepared draft Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for Organ Transport for
seven line ministries. MoHFW has circulated the draft SOPs to the Ministries concerned, following
which an introductory inter-ministerial meeting was chaired by Member (Health) on 1 November
2022, with participation from the Ministries and the National and Regional Organ & Tissue Transplant
Organisations, wherein inputs from states were also shared. The meeting was a first step to strengthen
organ transport and utilisation within the country. Further work towards an enhanced National Organ
Transplant Programme, in addition to strengthening the organ transport network, is ongoing.

Increasing Accessibility for Assistive Technologies
Assistive Technology (AT) may include any items, equipment, software programme, or product system
that are used to increase, maintain, or improve the functional capabilities of persons with disabilities.
Besides this, ATs are also used to overcome the functional-loss related to senile changes such as
a decrease in vision or hearing or locomotor disability in the human body and also in overcoming
disabilities owing to intellectual or learning disabilities. NITI Aayog is working closely with agencies
like Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and World Health Organisation (WHO) to understand
the unmet need and potential of the sector in an effort to improve the access and reach of ATs to
those who require it the most.

Transforming Emergency and Trauma Care System: Concept for a New

Mission under Ayushman Bharat

India witnesses a huge burden of emergency and trauma cases, composed of a high proportion of
the young, who are often the sole bread-earners and inflicts high out-of-pocket-expenditure, adding
urgency to address these health issues. Addressing these issues would also contribute towards
achieving multiple SDG targets, including halving the number of global deaths and injuries from road-
traffic accidents by 2030 and also cover emergencies arising due to obstetrics, pediatrics, infections,
NCDs and disasters. There is an immediate need to address these issues in a comprehensive manner,
highlighting the need for a strong, holistic ambulance–emergency–trauma care system.

NITI Aayog has been working on the scheme along with MoHFW, MoRTH and other stakeholders, and
conducted a 100-facility study (with AIIMS, New Delhi) to assess the current state of emergency care,
besides studying models in various States and other countries, embracing WHO recommendations.
Multiple high-level presentations on this scheme have been made, involving the highest offices,
wherein it has found traction and is under further refinement for better adaptation.

Expansion of MD Doctors Through Family Medicine Training Programme

It is expected that a vibrant MD Family Medicine Programme or course across India’s premier AIIMSs/
INIs will spur the starting of such courses in medical colleges across the country. The medium-
term goal is to have optimum access by people of India to family health/ general practice specialty
professional healthcare. In light of the need to augment Family Medicine programs in medical colleges
in the country, NITI Aayog is facilitating pathways for new All India Institute of Medical Science (AIIMSs)/
Institutes of National Importance (INIs) in the country to introduce Family Medicine programs in their
respective medical institutes.

Policy and Strategy for Health Insurance Coverage of India’s Missing Middle

Subsequent to the release of the NITI Aayog report ‘Health Insurance for India’s Missing Middle’, the
National Health Authority requested NITI Aayog to suggest a strategy to extend the health coverage to
the ‘missing middle’ which is a broad category of population which lacks health insurance, positioned
between the deprived poorer sections and the relatively well-off organized sector. Accordingly, a multi-
stakeholder committee, with Special Secretary, NITI Aayog as the Chair, was constituted and included
members from Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoH&FW), National Health Authority, and other
stakeholders including from the insurance sector.

The Committee is tasked with (i) devising a policy and strategy to extend or expand the health
coverage to the missing middle under the ambit of Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY) or
independent of it; (ii) devising the criteria for identification of the missing middle as an individual
or group and strategize a mechanism for their plausible enrollment or subscription for these;
(iii) suggesting ways for effective distribution, raising consumer awareness of health insurance; and
(iv) suggesting implementation pathways for extending coverage to missing middle. The Committee
has organized several stakeholder deliberations, and the final report is under preparation.

ASSET MONETIZATION

```
National Monetization Pipeline (NMP)
Core Asset Monetisation was identified as one of the country’s three pillars for enhanced and
sustainable infrastructure financing in the Union Budget 2021–22. The Budget tasked NITI Aayog with
creating the National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) for brownfield core infrastructure assets. The NMP,
laying down the framework for monetisation policy and listing the pipeline of potential core assets
of Central ministries/ CPSEs with an indicative value of Rs 6.0 lakh crore over a four-year period
(FY22-25), was released in August 2021. It serves as a medium-term roadmap for identifying potential
monetisation-ready projects across various infrastructure sectors, including roads, railways, aviation,
power, oil and gas, and warehousing.
Since its launch, NITI Aayog has worked closely with the ministries on investment and transaction
structuring, reviewing progress, and deliberating on inter-ministerial and structural issues. The target
set for FY22 (Rs 88,000 crores) was achieved, while the pipeline of proposals aggregating to ~Rs 1.4
lakh crore is at various stages of processing by the ministries concerned. Further, an aggregate target
of Rs 1,62,422 crores was envisaged for FY23, of which transactions with monetisation value in accruals
and/or investments of ~Rs 26,000 crores have been completed. Furthermore, the proposal pipeline
aggregating to ~Rs 1.23 lakh crore is currently at various stages of processing.
```
INDUSTRY

```
Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme
In order to provide an impetus to manufacturing in India and exports from India, NITI Aayog in
consultation with several associated ministries and departments had anchored the introduction of a
Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme in key sectors for a period of five years. The Scheme was
approved by the Union Cabinet in its meeting held on 11 November 2020.
```
POLICIES AND PROGRAMMES


The PLI Scheme is designed to incentivize incremental production for a limited number of eligible
anchor entities in each of the selected sectors who will invest in technology, plant & machinery, as
well as in R&D. The Scheme will also have beneficial spillover effects by the creation of a widespread
supplier base for the anchor units established under the scheme, thus generating massive primary
and secondary employment opportunities. The schemes are expected to lead to increased production
of over Rs. 40 Lakh Crore and are expected to generate additional 60 lakhs of employment in next
five years across 14 sectors.

NITI Aayog has worked extensively to prepare the contours of the individual PLI schemes along with
the concerned Ministries/Departments. All the schemes are presently under implementation. CEO,
NITI Aayog is a part of Empowered Group of Secretaries (EGoS) for monitoring the PLI schemes of all
the 14 sectors.

MISSION LiFE – LIFESTYLE FOR ENVIRONMENT

```
The Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi gave the vision of LiFE–Lifestyle for Environment during
COP 26 at Glasgow in 2021. LiFE envisages bringing everyone together to adopt an environmentally
conscious lifestyle for ‘mindful and deliberate utilization, instead of mindless and destructive
consumption’. Studies indicate that behaviors can help in reducing carbon emission substantially.
India believes that environment friendly behavior of an individual and the community in total can
have a significant impact on the environment and climate crisis. A healthy and sustainable way of
living based on traditions and the values of conservation and moderation is a key to mitigating climate
change. India is the only country that has included LiFE in its Nationally Determined Contributions
(NDCs). It has been decided that MoEF&CC will look after the Indian aspects of Mission LiFE, and NITI
Aayog will steer the global aspects of this Mission.

INTRODUCTION

To increase efficiency and improve decision making, evidence-based policy-making is essential.
The Development Monitoring and Evaluation Office (DMEO), an attached unit of NITI, envisions to
institutionalize the application and use of monitoring and evaluation at all levels of government
policy and programmes and help improve the efficiency, effectiveness, equity, sustainability, and
achievement of results. Evidence based policy making, strengthening data systems and architecture,
and strengthening M&E ecosystem are the key pillars of the DMEO.

In addition, NITI Aayog has also developed several indices and dashboards by focusing on effective
management and better outcomes backed by data analysis.

DEVELOPMENT MONITORING AND EVALUATION OFFICE

(DMEO)

DMEO is the apex Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) body of the Government of India. Under NITI
Aayog’s mandate of cooperative and competitive federalism, its ambit of work also includes technical
advisory to states. To have functional autonomy, a separate budgetary allocation has been provided
exclusively to DMEO.

DMEO’s role is: (i) to monitor the progress and efficacy of strategic and long-term policy and
programme frameworks as well as initiatives to facilitate improvements, including the necessary mid-

SECTION


```
course corrections; and (ii) to actively monitor and evaluate the implementation of programmes and
initiatives to strengthen the probability of success and scope of delivery.
```
MAJOR PROJECTS UNDERTAKEN BY DMEO IN 2022-23

```
$ Output-Outcome Monitoring Framework (OOMF)
$ Data Governance Quality Index (DGQI)
$ Monitoring of Global Indices for Reforms and Growth (GIRG)
$ Institutionalizing and Promoting Evaluations
$ Engagement with States
$ Capacity Building
```
```
Output–Outcome Monitoring Framework
The Output–Outcome Monitoring Framework (OOMF) is an important component of the union budget
and the same has been published annually since 2017–18. The goal is to institutionalize outcome
monitoring, to shift the focus of line ministries of Government of India from tracking physical and
financial progress, to tracking the results of work done. Salient features of OOMF are as follows:
$ Every year, the Framework has been laid in Parliament along with the Union Budget for 4
consecutive years
$ Rule 54, General Financial Rules 2017 makes OOMF an integral process for ministries/
departments
$ Covers 67 ministries/departments
$ 500+ Central Sector (CS) and Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) with a cumulative INR 11+
lakh crore annual budgetary outlay
$ 5000+ output and outcome indicators tracked on the dashboard through progress and
compliance reports
Since 2020, annual review meetings related to OOMF of various ministries/departments have been
conducted under the chairpersonship of Vice Chairman and Members, NITI Aayog along with the
Secretaries of the ministries/departments to review (i) the progress of Central Sector/ Centrally
Sponsored Schemes; (ii) monitor outcomes of schemes especially towards achieving the National
Development Agenda and Sustainable Development goals, (iii) progress on actionable points pertaining
to the previous year’s OOMF review meeting and (iv) other issues and challenges. A total of 37 and 53
such review meetings have been conducted during 2020-21 and 2021-22 respectively. As of 18 January
2023, around 30 meetings had been completed for the fiscal year 2022-23.
Further, to improve the quality of OOMF a continuous capacity building exercise and systematic review
of the framework and indicators of all CS/CSS schemes is undertaken throughout the year. It has
also been DMEO’s constant endeavour to improve the capacity of officials working at different level
of the government. The OOMF framework has immense potential in improving the performance of
schemes and enhancing efficiency as well as effectiveness of government interventions. In this context,
DMEO has organized several knowledge-sharing and capacity-building sessions with central and state
government officials during the 2022-23.
```
MONITORING AND EVALUATION


Data Governance Quality Index (DGQI)

After the final DGQI 2.0 report cards for 74 ministries/departments were shared in February 2022 the
DGQI dashboard was launched for use by ministries/departments in March 2022. Using this dashboard,
the second round of the DGQI 2.0 exercise was conducted during April – June, 2022 to gather the status
updates on the data systems of ministries/departments for Quarter 4, FY 2021-22. The draft report
including the findings of the second round of DGQI 2.0, was shared with ministries/departments in
October 2022.

```
Enhanced scope of DGQI 2.0 exercise compared to DGQI 1.0
```
With the objective of widely disseminating learnings from the DGQI exercise, a DGQI methodology
toolkit was published on the DMEO website and shared with States/UTs to enable them to conduct
similar data maturity assessments.

A compendium of good practices in using administrative data for monitoring and evaluation was also
published on the DMEO website to promote peer learning among ministries/departments and States.

A webinar on key insights from DGQI for States/UTs was held in April 2022. Similarly, a training session
was organized for 180 Indian Administrative Service probationers at the Lal Bahadur Shastri National
Academy of Administration (LBSNAA).

Institutionalising and Promoting Evaluations

DMEO conducts evaluation under the overarching guidance of the Development Evaluation Advisory
Committee (DEAC), reconstituted under the chairpersonship of Vice Chairman, NITI Aayog in June 2021.
The members of the committee include CEO, NITI Aayog; Secretaries, Finance, Expenditure, and Rural
Development; and 3 independent experts. Studies are taken up as per the rolling evaluation plan
approved by the DEAC. Additionally, DMEO also conducts evaluation based on the request received
from Ministries/Departments and also takes up other evaluation/assessments/review as per need.

```

Evaluations of Schemes Requested by the Department of Expenditure,
Ministry of Finance
DMEO is in the process of finalizing the evaluation studies of select Central Sector schemes in various
sectors such as MSME, Commodity Boards, industrialisation of North-East, Science and Technology and
Biotechnology pertaining to some ministries, as per the request of the Department of Expenditure.
For the evaluation of these Central Sector schemes, the consultancy work was awarded to various
consultants/institutions through a transparent tendering process.
```
```
Evaluations of Major Schemes
As per the mandate of DEAC, DMEO is undertaking evaluation of various schemes related to roads,
transport, connectivity, energy and food and nutritional security. Evaluations of other important Central
Sector (CS) schemes and Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) are also being initiated.
```
```
Organization Evaluation Framework
DMEO is undertaking evaluations of key organizations and public sector enterprises. In this context,
DMEO has developed an Organization Evaluation Framework in the spirit of improving the efficacy
of organizations that deliver services to the population at large.The said framework encompasses
evaluation of an organization’s performance in terms of its effectiveness (mission fulfilment),
efficiency, ongoing relevance (the extent to which the organization adapts to changing conditions in
its environment), and financial viability. Projects related to such organisations are also to be evaluated.
The objective of the project level evaluation is to identify the challenges, gaps, best practices and
areas for improvement. This evaluation assesses project design and logical framework, relevance,
effectiveness, efficiency and sustainability of projects, socio-economic impact and the role of other
departments and agencies in a project’s success.
```
```
Capacity Building
One of DMEO’s goals is to institutionalize the application of monitoring and evaluation at all levels of
government policy and programs by helping improve the efficiency, effectiveness, equity, sustainability,
and achievement of results. DMEO has been taking several initiatives to build individual and institutional
capacities at the central and state levels over the last year. These initiatives are supported through
synergistic partnerships with government stakeholders, global experts, think tanks and academic
organizations.
```
```
Capacity Building of State-Level Universities
DMEO, in pursuance of the goal of cooperative federalism, is engaging with Central and State universities
for knowledge-sharing as well as promoting monitoring and evaluation. The initial partnership with this
network of universities and academic institutions is aimed at conducting quick field-level assessments
of important beneficiary-oriented schemes.
```
```
Statement of Intent (SoI) with Capacity Building Commission (CBC)
In August 2022, DMEO and CBC signed a Statement of Intent (SoI) for enhancing the execution capacity
of the Indian state by radically improving the government’s human resource management practices
and augmenting the capacity of India’s 25 million civil servants. The SoI has been signed with the
intent of creating the optimal learning opportunities for civil servants wherein DMEO and CBC will

DMEO organized the 5th Development Partners’ Meet: Roundtable on Transformation of Monitoring
and Evaluation Capacities in States in August 2022. The purpose of the roundtable was to apprise
DMEO’s development partners of the progress on various activities undertaken by DMEO and to share
opportunities for collaboration in strengthening the M&E ecosystem in India.

PERFORMANCE DASHBOARD

Champions of Change, Aspirational Districts Programme

The Champions of Change dashboard for real-time data collection and monitoring opened for public
viewing on 1 April 2018. The dashboard has been named so to emphasize the critical role played by
the district collectors/magistrates and their teams in the progress of districts. Aspirational Districts
Programme hinges on inducing competition among 112 districts through regular ranking, which is
dynamic and reflects the incremental (delta) improvement made every month. Districts are encouraged
to improve their data collection and maintenance mechanisms to enter up-to-date data on the
dashboard.

The Champions of Change portal (CoC 2.0) has been upgraded to further empower the District
Administrations towards data-driven governance and evidence-based policy making. CoC 2.0 hosts
many new features such as Citizen Reports, Citizen Feedback, Advanced Analytics, Project Management,
Geo-Spatial Maps and other AI/ML Solutions.

```
MONITORING AND EVALUATION
```

```
The Citizen Reports comprise of 3 dashboards based on the analysis of the CoC data:
```
1. Performance of Aspirational Districts since Inception.
2. Delta Ranking of Districts that is released every month.
3. Indicator level progress across Themes for all the districts.
In addition to these reports, the District Administrations have access to a Data Visualization tool to
perform advanced analytics for analysing their performance using the CoC data.

MONITORING AND EVALUATION


The Districts can also compare their performance with other districts in the state or the best among
all Aspirational Districts, triangulate their analysis with other data sources such as National Family
Health Survey (NFHS), Census and 3rd party survey data, and upload block level or gram panchayat
level data as well for analysis.

COC 2.0 also comes with a fully digitised Project Management workflow. District authorities can use this
portal to obtain additional funds under the Externally Aided Programme (EAP-SDG) of NITI Aayog and
through CPSE’s Corporate Social Responsibility. The Advanced Project Management System assists the
districts in preparation of relevant projects which can directly or indirectly impact the socio-economic
indicators in these Aspirational Districts. The Project Management workflow also has a provision to
monitor the implementation of the projects as well as the fund flow in the districts with minimal
paperwork. The districts have provision to upload the pictures as evidence to support the completion
and impact of the project as a part of the monitoring framework.

```
MONITORING AND EVALUATION
```

```
In order to take concrete steps towards realizing the Hon’ble Prime Minister’s Vision to improve
farmers’ incomes, NITI Aayog, in collaboration with the National Bureau of Soil Survey (Indian Council
of Agricultural Research), mapped Aspirational Districts in order to support the administration in
sustainable farming and agriculture. The Geospatial Analytics platform provides mapping for the
purpose of (1) Alternate Land Use Planning to improve farmer incomes; for crop diversification and
maintaining ecological balance in the district, and (2) Soil and Water Conservation to reduce soil
erosion and contamination, improve irrigation facilities and provide probable check dam locations.
One of the most important features in this new platform is the automated system generated mailers
on data quality and monthly performance. Automated mailers are sent to the districts highlighting
any discrepancies in data entered by them, based on pre-configured logics in the system. This has
helped enhancing the overall data quality of the programme and subsequently the analysis of the
performance of the districts. System generated monthly performance reports are also sent to the
District Magistrates/District Collectors, Central Prabhari Officers/State Prabhari Officers and the Chief
Secretaries of the State, detailing their performance on various indicators.

SDG India Index and Dashboard
The SDG India Index dashboard allows users to visualize and explore the data in the SDG India Index
reports. The dashboard is updated annually—every time a new edition of the index is launched—and
has cross-sectoral relevance for policy makers, civil society, business and academia. Additionally, two
interactive dashboards have also been developed for the North-Eastern Region District SDG Index and
the SDG Urban Index which can be accessible at following links respectively https://sdgindiaindex.niti.
gov.in/NER/dashboard/#/ and https://sdgindiaindex.niti.gov.in/urban/#/ respectively.

```
Sustainable Development Goals North-Eastern Region District Index
NITI Aayog released a first-of-its-kind North-Eastern Region (NER) District SDG Index and dashboard
in August 2021. The North Eastern Region District SDG Index is another milestone in NITI Aayog’s
efforts in localising the SDGs from ‘global to national to local’. It focuses on the North-Eastern Region,
which is of critical significance to the country’s development trajectory. The index ranks the Districts
of the eight States of the NER—Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland,
Sikkim, and Tripura—based on their relative performance on Sustainable Development Goals and their
corresponding targets. An interactive dashboard was also prepared to allow users to explore and
visualise the data in the NER District SDG Index Report. The dashboard allows for region-level and
district-level insights and can be a helpful tool for extracting critical insights from the NER District
SDG Index data.
```
MONITORING AND EVALUATION


The construction of the index and the ensuing methodology embodies the central objectives of
measuring the performance of districts on the SDGs and ranking them. It intends to support States in
identifying critical sectoral gaps which require more attention; strengthening statistical and monitoring
systems; and promoting healthy competition among them.

While computing the Index, all aspects related to the selection of indicators and computation
methodology of the NER District SDG Index and Dashboard followed an extensive process of consulting
all the eight States of the region. States played a crucial role in shaping the index by enriching the
feedback process with localised insights and field experience.

The next edition—North East SDG Index 2.0—is in progress.

KEY INDICES TO PROMOTE COMPETITIVE FEDERALISM

School Education Quality Index (SEQI 2.0)

NITI Aayog’s School Education Quality Index (SEQI) aims to assess the performance of all States/
UTs on school education outcomes (access, equity, learning outcomes) and governance, based on
identified indicators. The indicators are largely based on data from the National Achievement Survey
(NAS, 2017, 2021) and U-DISE (2016-17, 2020-21), along with a few indicators for which data is provided
by the concerned States/ UTs.

The first version of SEQI was released by NITI Aayog in September 2019, based on the learning outcomes
data of NAS 2017. With the next round of NAS (2021) released this year, NITI is working towards the next
version of SEQI, i.e., SEQI 2.0. In this context, following the regional training workshops, the Vertical has
carried out a data cleaning exercise with respect to the data filled for the indicators by the states/
UTs. The data cleaning exercise has been completed with all 36 states and UTs, and the exercise has
moved to the next phase, data validation and data certification. Institute of Competitiveness is the
3 rd party carrying out the data validation exercise.

The vertical is simultaneously looking at the technical developments on the SEQI Portal and website
for SEQI 2.0. with support from Institute for Competitiveness.

State Energy and Climate Index: Round 1

NITI Aayog has developed a State Energy & Climate Index (SECI) Round-1, which ranks the states’
performance on six parameters, namely, (1) DISCOM’s Performance (2) Access, Affordability and
Reliability of Energy (3) Clean Energy Initiatives (4) Energy Efficiency (5) Environmental Sustainability;
and (6) New Initiatives. The index consists of 27 indicators. On the overall composite score, the states
and UTs are categorized into three groups: Front Runners, Achievers, and Aspirants based on size and
geographical differences as larger states, smaller states, and UTs.

In the first edition, which is based on 2019–20 data, Gujarat, Kerala, and Punjab have been ranked as
the top three performers in the category of larger states. Goa, emerged as the top-performing state
in the smaller states category, followed by Tripura, and Manipur. Among UTs, Chandigarh, Delhi, and
Daman & Diu/Dadra & Nagar Haveli are the top performers.

Detailed state profiles and scorecards have been included in the report which provides a comprehensive
snapshot of each state and union territory on the various parameters. NITI Aayog launched the State
Energy & Climate Index–Round 1 on 11 April 2022.

Global Innovation Index

An Inter-Ministerial Coordination Committee constituted by NITI Aayog under the chairpersonship of
the CEO, NITI Aayog monitors the progress of updating the data/inputs on the Global Innovation Index
(GII) and suggests reform actions for improving India’s ranking in the GII.

```

```
India Innovation Index
The S&T Vertical in NITI Aayog is responsible for ranking the States/UTs based on their innovative
capabilities by releasing the India Innovation Index every year, in coordination with the Institute for
Competitiveness as a knowledge partner.
NITI Aayog released the ‘India Innovation Index 2021’ on 21 July 2022. The framework for India Innovation
Index 2021 was revised with the number of indicators increased from 36 (of the India Innovation
Index 2020) to 89, to match—to the extent possible—the 80 indicators of the already released Global
Innovation Index 2021. This enables the index to have an improved evaluation of the innovation
performance of the states and provides the states with insights to design policy solutions and reforms
to improve their future performance.
NITI Aayog, as a part of the effort to reinvigorate cooperative federalism, is also extensively supporting
States and UTs in improving their ranking in the India Innovation Index. The development and
improvement in innovation performance at the state level will subsequently result in the improvement
of India’s ranking in the Global Innovation Index as well.
```
```
State Health Index: Round V
NITI Aayog, in collaboration with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and with technical
assistance from the World Bank, has been spearheading the Health Index initiative since 2017 to
measure the annual performance of States and Union Territories on a variety of indicators: health
outcomes, governance, and processes. The index aims to nudge States towards transformative action
in the health sector. NITI Aayog is committed to establishing the health index as an annual systematic
tool to focus the attention of the States/UTs on achieving better health outcomes. The importance of
this tool is reemphasized by MoH&FW’s decision to link the index to incentives under the National
Health Mission. This has been instrumental in shifting the focus from budget spending and inputs to
outputs and outcomes. The index report for Round IV was released in December 2021; Round V is in
the final release stage.
```
```
District Hospital Index: Round II
NITI Aayog, in close collaboration with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and technical
support from WHO India and other stakeholders, developed a framework to assess the performance
of District Hospitals. In the first round, 707 District Hospitals across the country were assessed on
10 key performance indicators (KPIs) across the domains of ‘Structure’ and ‘Output’ based on Health
Management Information System (HMIS) data for the year 2017–18. The top-performing District Hospitals
were identified and their best practices collected and documented in the report titled ‘Best Practices
in the Performance of District Hospitals’.
NITI Aayog has initiated the second round of the District Hospital Index, wherein the performance of
District Hospitals, excluding medical college hospitals, will be analyzed on a set of 17 KPIs covering
the domains on Structure, Process, Output, and Outcome. The performance assessment will be done
primarily based on HMIS data for FY 2020-21 and FY 2021-22. Data validation of HMIS data of the facility
vis-à-vis their corresponding physical records is entrusted with an independent validation agency. It
is being done for a representative sample of about 10% of the total District Hospitals, following which
the index report will be prepared, covering District Hospitals across the country.

Territories (UTs) in effective Water Management and Governance. This exercise is being successfully
pursued since 2016-17 and so far, published two editions with enthusiastic participation of States and
Union Territories. The latest edition, in fact, comprises of two sets of indices 3.0 and 4.0 for the years
2018-19 and 2019-20 respectively. The index combines the strengths of co-operative federalism and
competitive wherein the States and UTs are directly involved in data collection, analysis & discussion
and maintain healthy competition among them to improve the performance.

Export Preparedness Index 2022

```
The Export Preparedness Index (EPI) has been developed by NITI Aayog in partnership with Institute
for Competitiveness in order to rank all States and UTs on the basis of their export readiness and
performance. The EPI is based on four pillars—Export Policy, Business Environment, Export Infrastructure,
and Export Performance. The major objectives of the EPI are:
$ Examining export preparedness and performance of Indian States
$ Identification of challenges and opportunities at State level
$ Providing key insights for enhancing export performance.
$ Encouraging facilitative regulatory framework
```
EPI can be used by States and UTs to benchmark their performance against their peers and analyze
the potential challenges to develop better policy mechanisms to foster export-led growth at the sub-
national level. The Index will also provide analytical insights and inputs to States and UTs to improve
upon their understanding of future export opportunities.

After the success of EPI-2020, the second edition of the Export Preparedness Index-2021 was released
in March 2022. The third edition of EPI is under preparation.

Multidimensional Poverty Index

The Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) is an internationally accepted high-resolution household-
level measure of non-monetary poverty covering over 100 developing countries. It captures the
deprivation faced by households across 3 dimensions i.e. health, education, and standard of living
and across 10 indicators. The national MPI project is aimed at deconstructing the global MPI and
creating a globally aligned but customized Indian MPI for devising reform action plans with the larger
goal of improving India’s position in the global MPI rankings. It captures the deprivation faced by a
household across three dimensions of Health, Education and Standard of Living across 12 indicators,
2 additional indicators capturing the national priorities of maternal health and financial inclusion.

The national MPI baseline report is based on NFHS-4 (2015–16) and serves as a useful source for
measuring the situation at the baseline i.e., before the large-scale rollout of nationally important
schemes on housing, sanitation, electricity, cooking fuel, nutrition, etc. This will help in measuring
the changes over time when compared with NFHS-5 (2019–20). The customised national MPI aims to
provide opportunities to the Central and State governments to understand the multiple factors that
are hindering growth, and assist them in making interventions more effective and durable. Estimates
of national MPI headcount ratio and intensity have been prepared not only for the States and Union
Territories, but also for all the districts, which is a unique feature of the report. This will not only
enable the analysis of comparative and relative performance among States and UTs but also enable
states to undertake a comparative analysis of their districts, thus, highlighting regional disparities.

Further, the identification of priority indicators, and the development of reform action plans to address
the pressing challenges of multidimensional poverty in the States and UTs is undertaken by the inter-
ministerial MPI Coordination Committee (MPICC) comprising 12 member ministries, with NITI Aayog as
the convener. The next edition of the report based on NFHS-5 is under preparation.

Sustainable Development Goals India Index

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) India Index has been comprehensively documenting and
ranking the progress made by the States and UTs towards the achievement of Sustainable Development
Goals.

```
SDG India Index Dashboard 2020-21
```
The index facilitates in identifying crucial gaps and informs interventions to fast-track progress towards
achieving the SDGs at the national and sub-national levels. It acts as a ready reckoner for gauging
progress on the expansive set of the Global Goals on health, education, gender, economic growth,
institutions, climate change and environment, among others.

The SDG India Index 2020–21 was more robust than the previous editions on account of wider coverage
of targets and indicators. The 115 indicators incorporate 16 of the 17 SDGs, with a qualitative assessment
of Goal 17, and cover 70 SDG targets. This is an improvement over the 2018–19 and 2019–20 editions of
the index, which had utilized 62 indicators across 39 targets and 13 Goals, and 100 indicators across
54 targets and 16 Goals, respectively.

The next edition is under preparation with more comprehensive coverage of targets and indicators.

INTRODUCTION

Strong States make a strong nation. The State Support Mission is an overarching umbrella initiative of
NITI Aayog to reinvigorate its ongoing engagement with States and Union Territories in a more structured
and institutionalized manner in order to achieve the transformational objectives envisioned for 2047,
when India would be celebrating its 100 years of Independence. In the area of school education,
Project SATH-E, ‘Sustainable Action for Transforming Human Capital-Education’, was launched to build
three ‘role model’ States. Further, with the aim of correcting regional developmental imbalance, NITI
Aayog has taken special steps for areas requiring special attention and support, such as those in the
North-East, Andaman and Nicobar and Lakshadweep islands, and the Himalayas.

STATE SUPPORT MISSION (SSM)

NITI Aayog intends to partner with all States/UTs in realising the aspirations of _Vikasit Bharat @_ 2047
by energising the spirit of cooperative and competitive federalism. To this end, the State Support
Mission has been conceived as an overarching umbrella initiative of NITI Aayog to reinvigorate its
ongoing engagement with States and Union Territories in a more structured and institutionalized
manner. Under the Mission, NITI Aayog is supporting the States/UTs to develop inclusive growth
strategies to achieve their socio-economic goals and to establish State Institution for Transformation
(SIT). These SITs will steer the development strategies required in the States/UTs to achieve the
stated goals. States/UTs may either choose to establish SITs or reimagine the role of their existing

institutions, such as planning departments and boards, with the support of NITI Aayog. In addition,
the Mission will provide holistic support to States/UTs, which, inter-alia, includes developing the
State Vision, setting their economic goals, establishing robust monitoring and evaluation systems, and
promoting the innovation ecosystem, among others. The Mission also seeks to leverage the expertise
of academic institutions, development partners, multilateral agencies, and civil societies to assist the
states in implementing their vision.
NITI Aayog has already reached out to all the States to advocate the merit of having SITs in their
respective States. A few states have announced the establishment of SITs, which include Karnataka
(State Institute for Transormation of Karnataka), Maharashtra (MITRA – Maharashtra Institute for
Transformation), Uttar Pradesh (STC – State Transformation Commission), and Uttarakhand (SETU –
State Institute of Empowering and Transforming Uttarakhand). NITI Aayog has also received requests
from states such as Rajasthan, Puducherry, Chhattisgarh, Chandigarh, and Nagaland seeking knowledge
and technical support from NITI Aayog to prepare State Vision document and development strategies.

_Key Interventions of Project SATH-E_

Under the project, a system-wide diagnostic was carried out in all three states to identify the
roadblocks in achieving grade-level competency for all students. Consequently, a three-year roadmap
was prepared in collaboration with the respective state governments. Targeted teaching at the level
of the students, tech-based monitoring system, data-backed review processes, customized teacher
training and mentoring support, etc., were a few of the interventions under the project, which has
led to considerable improvement in all three States. Project SATH has achieved success in terms of
access, equity, and quality in education, with a specialized focus on Out-of-School Children (OoSC),
dropouts, and learning outcomes.

SDG LOCALIZATION

Localization of the Sustainable Development Goals is crucial to
any strategy aimed at achieving the 2030 Agenda. Essentially,
localizing SDGs involves understanding, adapting, planning,
implementing, and monitoring the SDGs from the national to
the local level, via relevant institutions. It includes setting up
an institutional mechanism, preparaing the vision document,
SDG mapping with schemes and departments, developing the
state/district and the block indicator framework, developing
the SDG dashboard, budget linking with SDGs, capacity
building/training of officials , involving CSOs/ CSR in awareness
generation and capacity building.

```

The SDG Vertical at NITI Aayog has conducted consultations and workshops with Government/
Administration of 28 States and Union Territories, regarding monitoring of progress, evaluation of
actions and implementation of reforms to accelerate progress in the SDGs.
The state consultations saw great participation from the leadership, signaling ownership of the SDG
agenda at the highest levels. The state workshops have been chaired by the Chief Minister of the
state in most cases. In others, the workshops have been chaired by the Chief Secretary of the state.
These workshops saw large-scale participation of senior secretaries of line departments, heads of
departments, mid-level officers from the departments relevant to SDGs and statistical officers. District-
level officers also participated in the consultations. In these workshops, NITI Aayog’s flagship SDG
India Index serves as the principal monitoring and evaluation tool for driving the discussion forward.

ENGAGEMENT WITH STATES

DMEO’s Engagement with States

The Development Monitoring and Evaluation Office (DMEO) of NITI Aayog has been engaging with
States and UTs through periodic knowledge-sharing webinars, training programmes for capacity-
building along with sharing guidelines and toolkits on evaluation studies with individual States as per
their requirements. In 2022, DMEO organized five webinars with States and UTs on the Data Governance
Quality Index, Output Outcome Monitoring Framework of Odisha, social registry (Kutumba project) of
Karnataka, thematic report on behaviour change and the Chief Minister’s Monitoring Dashboard of
Gujarat. The webinars provided a platform for states to disseminate their best practices and engage
with each other.

In addition, DMEO launched a series of web-based roundtables with States and UTs. To enable learning
among states pertaining to monitoring and evaluation, DMEO, in collaboration with the Ministry of
Development of North Eastern Region and UNICEF, organized a roundtable discussion with senior
representatives from all the north-eastern states of India in Guwahati, Assam. The North East Council
also participated in the roundtable thereby enabling a discussion on the priorities for the region in
the context of the Sustainable Development Goals and Vision 2047.

The DMEO team visited Meghalaya to conduct a workshop on the implementation of the ‘Granular
Performance Monitoring Framework’. A summer school to develop Meghalaya as a learning state was
also conducted in August 2022, in partnership with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the
Government of Meghalaya. This programme opened up possibilities of a more nuanced approach
to monitoring and evaluation capacity building across the layers of governance from the State
headquarters to the far flung and less developed districts.

DMEO has also developed a diagnostic tool to assist State/UT Governments in institutionalizing
measures for strengthening evaluation. The DMEO team has conducted interviews with 31 States/UTs.
The draft reports for 22 States/UTs have been shared with for feedback. Preparation of draft reports
for other States/UTs and the national report is currently underway.

Carbon Capture, Utilisation, and Storage (CCUS)
It is critical for a developing nation like India to address the rising greenhouse gas emissions resulting
from a rapidly expanding industrial sector, without compromising its economic growth. Power, steel,
cement, refinery, and other heavy industrial sectors in India rely heavily, at present, on coal and
petroleum products. However, in the long-term, deep decarbonisation scenarios through Carbon
Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS), could play an important role to achieve net-zero emissions in
energy systems. In view of the above, the Science and Technology vertical of the NITI Aayog organised
a National Workshop on CCUS on 30 March 2022, in hybrid mode. The workshop brought together
government officials, industry leaders, and academia to discuss the role of CCUS in enabling a circular
economy for India.

Methanol Economy
India is poised to play a significant role in the global energy space with the demand expected to
rise at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.5 per cent till 2040. However, the dependence
of crude oil and natural gas has continually increased. Methanol and Dimethyl ether (DME) can play
an important role in order to curtail the rising imports and improve the energy security of India.
Moreover, India is at a nascent stage in methanol production and usage, but it has a large potential
given its wide applications. NITI Aayog has been driving national efforts towards widespread adoption
of a Methanol Economy in India.

### ATAL INNOVATION MISSION SECTION-VI

### MISSION

# 06

SECTION

INTRODUCTION

Atal Innovation Mission (AIM) is the Government of India’s flagship initiative to promote a culture
of innovation and entrepreneurship in the country. Since its inception in 2016, AIM has established
over 10,000 Atal Tinkering Labs, 69 Atal Incubation Centres, 14 Atal Community Innovation Centres
and has launched 24 Atal New India Challenges across sectors. With over 40 partnerships (domestic
and international) forged, AIM has successfully engaged over 75 lakh students, supported over 2900
startups (including 900+ women startups) and created over 32000 jobs.

AIM’s support across the Innovation Life-cycle


ATAL TINKERING LABS

```
With AIM, innovation and entrepreneurship have become an integral part of our national mission,
and children as young as 12 years of age are being introduced to the world of technology innovation,
with Atal Tinkering Labs (ATL) in schools. ATL is the flagship initiative of AIM, Government of India, to
nurture an innovative mindset amongst high school students across the length and breadth of India.
```
```
ATL Innovators with the President of India
```
```
Within ATL, students are free to think and explore, try and fail, even come up with something out of
the box. The programme is designed to equip students with the 21st century skills such as design
thinking, critical thinking, computational thinking, digital fabrication, collaboration and others.
Under the ATL scheme, grant-in-aid of up to twenty lakhs is provided to schools selected for setting
up the ATL. The ATL programme can be broadly classified into four major phases:
```
```
Framework of ATL programme
```
ATAL INNOVATION MISSION


(i) Select

As of October 2022, 10,000 ATLs have been sanctioned, covering 700 districts and 99 Aspirational
Districts of India, established in both government and private schools and majority in co-educational
and girls’ schools.

(ii) Establish

AIM, along with its partners, conducted several teacher training programs such as ATL ‘Unbox Tinkering’
to build capacities of resources attached to the ATLs. Till date, more than 5000 teachers have been
trained. Other teacher trainings conducted include IPR, App Development, ATL Game Development,
Ethics and Leadership in Innovation, Design Thinking Training etc.

(iii) Enable

Several online modules on innovation and technology skills launched for students including ATL
Artificial Intelligence Module, ATL Gaming Module, ATL CollabCAD Module, ATL App Development Module,
ATL Python Learning Module, 30+ Challenges organized for students, 31,000+ students participation.
AIM launched its flagship competitions and events such as ATL Marathon, ATL Tinkerpreneur, ATL
Community Day.

(iv) Celebrate

AIM recognizes and encourages all students, teachers and mentors for their innovation efforts and
good work, through multiple platforms and initiatives such as Wall of Fame, Exemplary Teachers of
Change, ATLs of the Month, Student Innovator Programme (SIP), Student Entrepreneurship Programme
(SEP).

```
ATAL INNOVATION MISSION
```

```
Mentor India
An important aspect of successful implementation of ATL is the robust partnerships forged with
different stakeholders including mentors, industry professionals and alumni, in order to leverage
their expertise towards guiding students on various innovation related skills. Sustainable institutional
frameworks that draw upon the capacity, resources, technical know-how of different partners are key to
ensure the success of the programme. Moreover, since tinkering as a concept is still new in our country,
advancing the idea requires sustained handholding support from mentors from the corporate world,
academia, institutes of higher education, government and others. Given that ATL is non-prescriptive by
nature, mentors are expected to be enablers rather than instructors. Technical knowhow, innovation
and design, business and entrepreneurship are some of the areas of contribution from the mentors.
AIM has engaged with 5800+ Mentors and 90 Regional Mentors of Change (RMoC).
The partners also help expand the technical horizons of the students by providing internship
opportunities and organizing other programmes, especially tailored for the ATL students.
AIM conducted events such as Mentor Round Table, a flagship recognition and celebration event to
recognize the top mentors and published GeM Book to share and celebrate the exceptional work
done by the Mentors of Change.
```
ATAL INCUBATION CENTRE

```
Atal Incubation Centre programme was launched in 2017 with a vision to build an ecosystem of
business incubators where entrepreneurs can gain access to a variety of facilities, including physical
infrastructure, training and education, and access to key stakeholders including investors, other
innovators, and mentors. Grant up to Rs 10 crores is given to the AICs/EICs over a 5-year period. AIM
has operationalized 69 AICs in Higher Education Institutions, Research Institutions, and Corporate,
among others. So far, 2900+ operational startups have been supported under the AIC programme,
which have created 15,000+ jobs directly.
Eighteen subsequent tranches, with a total outlay of Rs 33.70 crores, have been processed in 2022–23.

**2. Stories of Change** : Stories of Change is a movement to bring to the forefront lesser-known
    stories of impact created by innovators in their own communities. Stories of innovation in
    India (or across the globe) tend to demonstrate a city-centrism, being only from certain
    ‘developed’ pockets and those are most fervently repeated and reported. In coordination
    with ACICs, AIM seeks to identify and document success stories of grassroots innovators in
    their own region in the form of videos, articles and podcasts.

Key Highlights:

1. Fourteen ACICs have been operationalized across 9 States, with Fifteen undergoing
    compliance checks.
2. First Cohort of Community Innovator Fellows is undergoing a phase-wise journey initiated
    on 26th July 2022. The first cohort consists of 24 CIFs from the 14 ACICs.
3. AIM intends to establish over 50 ACICs by March 2023.

Telemedicine for Livestock Safety

In human health-services, telemedicine mode of treatment has proven to provide timely support,
especially during the Covid pandemic. A similar idea is proposed to be extended to the livestock sector.
A database is being created, containing the details of veterinary doctors and veterinary institutes in the
country. It is also proposed to create a ‘Livestock Wellbeing System’, where farmers and doctors can
register, and preventive and curative health services as well as information services may be availed. It
is proposed that pilot projects be carried out in select states in the country, and thereby move forward
with the design and hosting of the website. Presently, the system is available in three languages.

Promotion of Millets

In pursuance of the proposal of Government of India, the United Nations has declared the year 2023
as the International Year of Millets. NITI Aayog has signed a SoI with World Food Programme (WFP)
on 20 December 2021, focusing on mainstreaming millets through facilitation of knowledge exchange
and capacity strengthening within and outside India, while supporting climate-resilient practices for
improved food and nutrition security. The Mapping and Exchange of Good Practices (MEGP) initiative
was launched on 19 July 2022. During the launch ceremony, a web portal was unveiled, inviting entries
from various millet stakeholders in three categories — millet value chain, millet mainstreaming, and
millet recipes. The MEGP programme seeks to collate and bring together the international and national
best practices by regional conferences and the publication of a compendium. Technical workshops
have been conducted with State and UT Governments and different agricultural research institutes.

NITI Aayog has also been undertaking in-house millet promotional initiatives such as introduction of
millet based items in NITI canteens, conducting a series of training sessions for cooking millets and
a lecture on ‘Leveraging Millets for Food, Nutrition, Health and Economic Security’, setting up a millet
corner and a vending machine for sale of ready to eat and ready to cook millet products, etc.

Agroforestry for greening and restoration of waste land
Agroforestry is an agroecological nature-based land-use system that can simultaneously address many
ecological challenges of the current era viz. food, natural resources, soil degradation and environmental
security. Due to the significance of goods and services provided by agroforestry, the Union Budget
Announcement of Government of India (FY-2022-23) has underlined the promotion of agroforestry and
private forestry as a priority.
NITI Aayog has developed a geo-portal on “Greening and Restoration of Wastelands with Agroforestry
(GROW)” to delineate and prioritize areas especially wastelands suitable for agroforestry interventions
by using remote sensing datasets and GIS technology.
```
```
Working Group on Demand and Supply Projections
A working group on ‘Demand and Supply Projections of Crops, Livestock, Fisheries, and Agriculture
Inputs’ was constituted by NITI Aayog in August 2022. The working group, chaired by Prof. P. S. Birthal,
Director, ICAR–NIAP, will assess and project demand and supply of crops, livestock, fisheries and
agricultural inputs for 2025-26, 2030-31, and 2035-36.
```
```
Development of Framework for Economic Valuation of Ecosystem Services
in Agriculture
In recent years, intensive farming systems that utilize significant quantities of farm inputs in the
form of chemical fertilizers, pesticides, labour, and capital made it possible to produce sufficient
food to meet the current calorie needs of our population. However, indiscriminate use of inputs
in farming has become a major driver of land use change, resulting in environmental damage and
the degradation of several Ecosystem Services. Encouraging farmers to switch to sustainable crops/
farming systems may lead to upfront costs. Estimates of ecosystem services would help policymakers
to make environmentally sustainable decisions while promoting sustainable production systems like
natural farming.
NITI Aayog is developing a framework to evaluate ecosystem services in natural farming. An Expert
Committee is also constituted, involving experts from the public and private sector to develop toolkits
that help in economic valuation of ecosystem services in agriculture.
```
CIRCULAR ECONOMY

```
To give an impetus to the Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyaan, NITI Aayog, in consultation with the Ministry
of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC), identified eleven areas – municipal solid and
liquid wastes, scrap metal (ferrous and non-ferrous), lithium-ion (li-ion) batteries, tyre and rubber
recycling, gypsum, end-of-life vehicles, electronic waste, toxic and hazardous industrial waste, used
oil waste, agriculture waste, and solar panels – to facilitate the transition from a linear to a circular
economy. The Hon’ble PM in his address on Independence Day 2021 had also emphasised the transition
to a Circular Economy.
Action plans, which include both regulatory and developmental initiatives, in 10 sectors were finalized
by March 2022. Subsequently, the Circular Economy Cell was constituted in NITI Aayog on 16 September
2022 to give focused attention to the Circular Economy Mission. The various engagements of the Cell
are elaborated below.

Coverage and Beneficiary under National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013

The National Food Security Act (NFSA) addresses the food security issues by providing subsidized
food grains distribution programme to nearly two-thirds of the population. NFSA legislation conferred
a legal right on beneficiaries to obtain entitled quantities of food grains at highly subsidized prices.

NITI Aayog has studied the beneficiary inclusion/exclusion criteria under NFSA to ensure harmonization
of the beneficiary identification criteria across States/UTs by Department of Food & Public Distribution
(DFPD). Harmonisation of the beneficiary identification criteria across States/UTs would help in reducing
the gap in coverage of rightful beneficiaries and thereby improve targeting under NFSA.

National Ayush Research Consortium (NARC)

Ayush comprises the traditional systems of medicine practiced in India. There has been a renewed
upsurge towards the traditional medicine systems recently. However, to meet the provisions of the
international regulations, the data on Ayush medicine’s pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety,
etc., is essential to capitalize on this upsurge in terms of getting market authorization for Ayush
products as medicines at the global level.

NITI Aayog, in coordination with the Ministry of Ayush, has envisaged the formation of a National Ayush
Research Consortium (NARC) and prepared a concept note to prioritize Ayush research through scientific
collaboration within stakeholder Ministries and their departments/institutions in an institutionalized
manner and to address the fundamental problem that is holding back the global uptake of Ayush care.

Catalysing and Reforming Senior Care in India

With the accelerating pace of ageing, there is a need to reframe our thinking around ageing and the
needs of the elderly. The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), in its India Ageing Report, projected
that the elderly population (age 60 and above) in the country would grow to 158 million by 2025, and
further projected to rise to 319 million (19.5% of total population) by 2050.

Despite government and private sector efforts, the system for senior care faces many challenges,
including a lack of infrastructure and capacities to support the health and welfare of the elderly.
There are several strategies under various welfare schemes and initiatives for senior citizens which
can be better implemented through coordinated efforts by the Government and other stakeholders.
The specific interventions are needed in four areas: Health and Medical, Social and Legal, Economic/
Financial, and Digital, in terms of empowerment, service delivery & inclusion. NITI Aayog has prepared
a draft report on Catalyzing and Reforming Senior Care in India.

Strengthening Governance of Urban Health systems

India is facing an unprecedented scale of urbanization as cities are becoming hubs of growth, innovation
and creativity. To support this rapid urbanization and leverage the anticipated economic growth in the
cities, it is essential to ensure health and well-being of the citizens and provide a better quality of
life for all. A research project has been initiated by the vertical to understand the existing landscape
of urban health at a systems level using a holistic perspective, through a multidisciplinary approach.
Eight cities have been selected for the comprehensive study of the proposed task.

Cities as engines of growth

NITI Aayog, with technical assistance from Asian Development Bank (ADB), is undertaking a research
project that can pave path to a new approach to city planning with its foundation in urban economics.
Multiple consultations have been conducted wherein the NITI Aayog and ADB teams interacted with
more than 130 stakeholders from several states. Based on this, key bottlenecks have been identified
and recommendations for unlocking the potential of cities to become engines of economic growth
are being prepared.

Transition from cash-based to accrual-based accounting system in Urban

Local Bodies

Territory, who have declining or stagnant population, low levels of literacy, pre-agricultural level of
technology, are economically backward. To deliberate on the ongoing initiatives and bottlenecks in tribal
development about ten Sectoral experts were invited on 28 October 2022, along with representatives
from the Ministry of Tribal Affairs. The Experts have suggested several measures and reforms such
as exclusive sub-scheme for Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), Effective implementation
of Tribal Sub-Plan, strengthening of Integrated Tribal Development Agencies (ITDAs), Strengthening of
Panchayats in Scheduled Areas etc.

STATE FINANCES AND COORDINATION

The State Finances and Coordination Vertical seeks to strengthen coordination with States and serve
as a single point of contact for all matters pertaining to finances of States and multi-State issues.

State Finance Briefs including analysis of States’ Fiscal Health

Using the information available in State Budgets 2021-22, the Vertical analysed States’ fiscal and
financial health by assessing their performance in various key indicators like GSDP growth, per
capita GSDP, receipts including resources generated from own taxes, expenditures including capital
expenditure, social sector expenditure, fiscal and revenue deficit and its debt position.

Cross States analysis of key macroeconomic indicators of the States was also undertaken which is
being used in regular interactions/meetings with the State Governments/UTs to provide inputs for
future growth.

Allocation to States

Union Government endeavors to assist the states to meet the ‘spillover liabilities’ of their area specific
schemes and projects for which budget provision has not been made after the implementation of
Fourteenth Finance Commission recommendations and also to provide for need-based assistance to
the states keeping in view socio-economic-geographical factors. The State Finance and Coordination
Vertical acts as the nodal for all recommendations made from NITI Aayog to the Department of
Expenditure, Ministry of Finance relating to ‘Special Assistance’ to States under the demand ‘Transfers
to States’. A total amount of Rs. 1996 crore was released in FY21 to various States/UTs including Andhra

Aayog is not just to periodically collect data on SDGs but to proactively realise the goals and targets.
```
SECTORAL ACHIEVEMENTS


In 2015, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the document titled Transforming our World:
2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, consisting of 17 Sustainable Development Goals and 169
associated targets. The SDGs were adopted as a universal call-to-action for people, worldwide, to
address the five critical areas of importance by 2030: people, planet, prosperity, peace, and partnership.
The 17 SDGs and 169 targets are integrated and indivisible and balance the three dimensions of
sustainable development i.e. economic, social and the environmental. The determined goals and
targets were expected to stimulate action over the next 15 years in areas of critical importance for
humanity and the planet. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development: Transforming our world
pledge to focus on leaving no one behind. Countries are primarily responsible for monitoring and
reviewing the progress made in implementing the goals and targets at the national level, till 2030.
There is a convergence of India’s national development goals and agenda of, ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka
Vikas’ or ‘Collective Efforts, Inclusive Growth,’ with the SDGs.

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) India Index has been comprehensively documenting and
ranking the progress made by the States and UTs towards the achievement of Sustainable Development
Goals. The SDG Vertical at NITI Aayog has conducted consultations and workshops with Government/
Administration of 28 States and UTs, regarding monitoring of progress, evaluation of actions and
implementation of reforms to accelerate progress in the SDGs.

The state consultations saw great participation from the leadership, signaling ownership of the SDG
agenda at the highest levels. The state workshops have been chaired by the Chief Minister of the state
in most cases, or the Chief Secretary of the state (the administrative head of the state government), with
participation of senior secretaries of line departments, heads of departments, mid-level officers from
the departments relevant to SDGs and statistical officers. In these workshops, NITI Aayog’s flagship SDG
India Index serves as the principal monitoring and evaluation tool for driving the discussion forward.

TRADE AND COMMERCE

Study to quantify the effects of importing coal and minerals on various

aspects of the Indian economy

Given the huge potential of mineral and coal mining in accelerating economic growth and generating
huge employment opportunities, NITI Aayog undertook a study to highlight the benefits of indigenous
production over imports under the direction of the PMO. GTAP-based CGE modeling was used to
understand the impact not only of imports but also of pushing for increased domestic production.
Based on a framework created for the entire economy, simulations on the impact of imports and
production are being analyzed; work is in progress. Thirteen minerals and coal were identified for
the study, viz., iron ore, limestone, manganese, bauxite, lead, zinc, copper, tungsten, gold, silver, rock
phosphate, diamond, and nickel.

Study on Export Promotion Councils

The study examined the role and achievements of the existing institutional structures of export
promotion that exist in India at all levels (Central, state, and district levels), especially the Export
Promotion Councils (EPCs), Federation of Indian Export Organizations (FIEO), and Commodity Boards.

The study examines existing domestic best practices with respect to export promotion, including
initiatives taken by Ministries/Departments/State Governments or changes in policies with respect to
export promotion with a view to make recommendations on how Export Promotion Councils and the

Free Trade Agreements
Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) are arrangements between two or more countries or trading blocs
that primarily agree to reduce or eliminate customs tariff and non-tariff barriers on substantial
trade between them. Globally, there has been an increasing trend with respect to entering into FTAs.
Accordingly, the Trade Vertical has been continuously engaging with the Department of Commerce
in providing inputs on trade agreements. Through the use of economic modeling, the Vertical has
provided to the Department of Commerce the estimated potential benefit of trade agreements (both
existing and present). These include inputs on the India–UAE CEPA and India–Australia ECTA, and has
contributed inputs for the potential FTAs with GCC, Canada, EU and UK.
```
```
Global Trade Analysis Project–Computable General Equilibrium (GTAP–
CGE) Modeling
The Vertical undertook in-house research on Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) for analysing on-
going FTAs of India. Further, it undertook efforts to build capacity in the area of Computable General
Equilibrium (CGE) modelling within NITI Aayog. The Vertical received permission for NITI to be a part
of GTAP consortium to drive research in CGE modelling and get access to cutting edge research in
economic modelling.
```
```

VOLUNTARY ACTION CELL

```
The Voluntary Action Cell in NITI Aayog is primarily entrusted with the task to promote partnership
and voluntarism in the country. The cell maintains the database of NGOs and Voluntary Organizations
(VOs) in the country through the NGO Darpan portal, which was launched in 2017. The portal provides
a system-generated unique ID, which is mandatory to apply for grants under various schemes of
Ministries/Departments, to receive grants through the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act and CSR,
and to apply for 80G exemption. Verification of the NGO through Darpan’s unique ID is done by the
Ministries/Departments before releasing grants.
As of date, more than 1.5 lakh NGOs are registered on the NGO Darpan portal. For F.Y. 2021-22, 43
Ministries/ Departments released grants to NGOs/ VOs under various Central Sector Schemes and
Centrally Sponsored Schemes.
The NGO database has proven to be resourceful for a wide variety of communication and information
needs, especially for information dissemination within the voluntary sector in India, and circulating
details of various seminars, conferences, and award programs organized by the Ministries/ Departments
of the Government of India.

societies etc. The Vertical has analysed and documented selected best practices covering Agriculture,
Groundwater, Watershed, Water Infrastructure and Climate Risk & Resilience which could be replicated
across the country.
```
```
Rejuvenation of water bodies with community participation
NITI Aayog in association with two NGOs executed a pilot project in 10 Aspirational Districts, wherein
Government spent 26 per cent of the project cost. The NGO Partner rendered technical support and
carried out community mobilization, monitoring & evaluation, and technological acquisitions, which
constituted about 9 per cent of the project cost. Beneficiary community, at their own expense, carted
the excavated earth/silt to the farm field and spread it, which accounts for the remaining 65 per cent.
```
SECTORAL ACHIEVEMENTS


About 430 waterbodies in the 10 aspirational have been rejuvenated leading to additional approximately
383 crore litres of surface water capacity being created (a multiple of this would have been created
taking ground water recharge into account). This has positively impacted water security in 459 villages
bearing a population of approximately 9.5 lakh people. Discussions are under way to scale-up this
activity across the country.

Preparation of methodology for assessment of water neutrality, water

positivity and water negativity

Water conservation, efficiency improvement, waste water treatment, reuse and recycle are paramount
in ensuring water security. As more and more Industries are striving to achieve circular use of water,
clear methodology to define and assess water neutrality and water positivity are required. NITI Aayog
has constituted a steering committee under the chairpersonship of Prof. Ramesh Chand, Member,
NITI Aayog with Secretaries of the departments concerned as members to achieve this objective, and
the work is in progress. Representatives of academia and industry are also an inherent part of this
initiative.

Reuse of treated waste water for irrigation

Use of treated waste water has not gained much momentum in the country, though some of the
States are using it for industrial, landscaping and irrigation purposes to a certain extent. Considering
the pace of urbanisation, quantity of treated wastewater will increase over the years and has to be
put for beneficial use. Keeping this in view, a strategy paper covering different aspects of utilising
treated wastewater for irrigation in peri-urban areas is under preparation.

International technical papers

The Water & Land Resources vertical has published two international technical papers viz. (i) Whitepaper
on Indian Urban Wastewater Scenario at World Water Congress held in Copenhagen, Denmark in
September/2022. (ii) Impact of two Government of India schemes (PMKSY and PM-KUSUM) in Water–
Energy–Food Nexus at International Conference on Irrigation and Drainage held in Adelaide, Australia
in October 2022. Both papers received wide acclaim among international water experts.

Early State Experiences on Agricultural Land Leasing Acts Implementation

A draft report has been prepared by NRM, Centre for land governance, FLAME University, IIM Ahmedabad,
in collaboration with NITI Aayog, titled, Analysing Early State Experiences on Agricultural Land Leasing
Acts Implementation for Improved Land Governance & Inclusive Agricultural Transformation.

Integration of Libraries

As of now, different Ministries/ Departments have their own Libraries, but they work independently,
either in traditional or hybrid mode. Therefore, finding the available resources in a particular library
is challenging, even in the current digital environment. Integration of Government libraries in a digital
manner will help in better utilization of resources and provide a single digital platform to access the
resources, which may eventually become one Government one library (digitally). NITI Aayog constituted
a Task Force under the chairpersonship of Prof. Ramesh Chand, Member, NITI Aayog, to implement
the Integration of Libraries housed in various Ministries under the Government of India. The NITI
Aayog Library is coordinating this project. After several meetings, it was reiterated that this project,
when implemented, would maximize the utilization of existing resources across participating libraries,
including better access to the existing books in Libraries of the Government of India to the Officers
from one Ministry who may take documents or use e-resources from another. The Task Force submitted
its final report in September 2022 on implementing the Integration of Libraries.

The Library is an institutional member of the Indian Library Association (ILA), Central Government
Library Association (CGLA), and Delhi Library Association (DLA). Director (Library) and other officers
regularly attended/participated in International and National Conferences / Seminars / Meetings of
ILA, IASLIC, and CGLA, from time to time.
